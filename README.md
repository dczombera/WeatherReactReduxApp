# WeatherReactReduxApp

Beautifully minimalistic weather app made with made with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

It saves the history of all searched cities of the current session in the app's state and lists them. To offer some eye candy, the list makes use of [react-google-maps](https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps) to show a map of the city.

## It's sexy!

Here a quick look at the UI. The app uses the [react-sparklines](https://github.com/borisyankov/react-sparklines) component for the charts.
